            Review this PR for:
            1. **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases, type safety
            2. **Security**: Injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe operations (eval, exec, pickle, subprocess shell=True)
            3. **Performance**: N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, algorithmic complexity
            4. **Readability**: Clear naming, appropriate abstractions, consistent style
            5. **Testing**: Coverage gaps, assertion quality, edge case tests

            Focus on substantive issues. Do NOT flag:
            - Style issues (ruff handles these)
            - Type annotation gaps (pyright handles these)
            - Minor naming preferences

            If the PR is clean, say so and approve.
